          <p>Classes are divided by the year of the gymnasts birth, but each class is worked so that children of similar skills and abilities are able to work and progress together. Boys and girls train together in these classes, though they get opportunities to use the gender specific apparatus as part of their training.</p>
          <p>Classes run every week day.</p>

          <p>Gymnastics is a competetive sport, so we try to arrange opportunities throughout the year for all gymnasts who wish to compete at internal and external events. Should a gymnast show talent, they may be invited to join our competition squads and take part in regional and national events.</p>
